[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/UCB-stat-159-f25/hw-2-AsianTonyStark1001/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2FLOSC_Event_tutorial.ipynb) <br>

# Summary:
This repository contains files BBH_events_v3.json, GW150914_4_template.hdf5, H-H1_LOSC_4_V2-1126259446-32.hdf5, L-L1_LOSC_4_V2-1126259446-32.hdf5, environment.yml, LOSC_Event_tutorial.ipynb, and other required files. The purpose of this reposistory is to make the repository a reproducible research package with installable utilities and conda environment. Furthermore, the link of a Binder above directly leads to the LOSC_Event_tutorial.ipynb. This repo also contains 4 tags that can be found under Tags. <br>

_This repository is public so that Binder can find it. All code and data is based on the original [LIGO Center for Open Science Tutorial Repository](https://github.com/losc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial). This repository is a class exercise that restructures the original LIGO code for improved reproducibility, as a homework assignment for the [Fall 2025 installment of UC Berkeley's Stat 159/259 course, _Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science](https://ucb-stat-159-f25.github.io/site/). Authorship of the original analysis code rests with the LIGO collaboration._
